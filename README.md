Scala IDE semantic annotations demo
===================================

This project contains a demo for new Scala IDE semantic annotations extension point.

If you build it as a plugin and plug it into your Scala IDE it will annotate all method calls on mutable collections.

For more informations see [official documentation](http://scala-ide.org/docs/dev/setup/extensions.html) (it's not there yet, but will be after PR will be accepted).
